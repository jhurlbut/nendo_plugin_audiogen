## Things that work generally

**320kbps 48khz** - these ensure quality of the recordings, reducing hiss & usually expanding the sound range. These numbers are just rather high for an MP3 recording but not near the values of a raw audio recording. Don't apply this to sound that is supposed to be LOFI (like Lofi hip hop) because it undoes their intent : 22kbps quality should start sounding like you're listening to a song through a telephone or through a megaphone
